# TODO

Backlog and shipped log. New items get added as they come up; completed
items stay ticked as a reference of what's been done in each area.

## Conventions

**Priority** (urgency, not difficulty):

- **P0** — blocker, user-facing breakage, or data-loss risk. Drop other work.
- **P1** — important; schedule into the next working session.
- **P2** — nice-to-have, polish, or exploratory.

**Format:**

```
- [ ] **P1** Short imperative description — optional context / why.
- [x] **P2** Same shape, ticked once shipped — leave it for the record.
```

Use `- [~]` for in-progress. Within each epic, list open items first
(P0 → P2, then by date added) and ticked items at the bottom.

## Core

Worker runtime, frontend shell, i18n, build/CI, tooling. Anything not tied to
a single platform.

- [x] **P2** Dark / light / system theme toggle — shipped 2026-05-20 (reconciled; full impl already in `lib/theme` + `ThemeToggle`).
- [x] **P2** Bulk download from multiple URLs — shipped 2026-05-20; mode toggle on the form, sequential resolve with 500ms politeness gap, per-URL result rows.
- [x] **P2** PWA + mobile share-target — shipped 2026-05-20; web manifest with `share_target`, URL pre-fill on launch via `readShareTargetUrl()`, query-string stripped via `history.replaceState`.
